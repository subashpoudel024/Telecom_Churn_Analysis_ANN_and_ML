This is the project of Telecom Churn Analysis where i've built a model to predict 
whether the customer is likely to leave the service or not.

The dataset is extracted from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Content:
      -Each row represents a customer, each column contains customer’s attributes described on the column Metadata.

The data set includes information about:

      - Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn.
      
      - Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device 
        protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies.
        
      - Customer account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, 
       and total charges.
       
      - Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.
      
Target:
      - The 'Churn' column is our target.




I've used the following models:
1. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
2. Machine Learning Models:
      - KNN Neighbours
      - Logistic Regression
      - Naive Bayes Classifier
      - Decision Tree Classifier
      - Random Forest Classifier

Following steps are included in the project:
1. Data collection and Pre-Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Prediction
