This is the project of Telecom Churn Analysis where i've built a model to predict 
whether the customer is likely to leave the service or not.


I've used the following models:
1. Artificial Neural Network(ANN)
2. Machine Learning Models:
      - Logistic Regression
      - Naive Bayes Classifier
      - Decision Tree Classifier
      - Random Forest Classifier

Following steps are included in the project:
1. Data collection and Pre-Processing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Model Training
4. Model Evaluation
5. Model Prediction
